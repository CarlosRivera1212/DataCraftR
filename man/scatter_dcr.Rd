\details{
Scatter Plot Addin for Interactive Data Generation


This gadget integrates Shiny and D3.js for dynamic scatter plot visualization.
Users can adjust:
\itemize{
  \item The number of groups and the active drawing group.
  \item Brush diameter for point drawing.
  \item Maximum X and Y axis values.
}
Interactive buttons allow resetting the plot, undoing/redoing actions, and exporting the generated data.

The D3.js code handles drawing and interactivity, while Shiny manages user inputs and server-side data handling.
