Histogram Addin for Interactive Data Generation


This gadget integrates Shiny and D3.js for dynamic histogram generation and visualization.
Users can adjust:
\itemize{
  \item The number of variables to display.
  \item The variable to draw on the histogram.
  \item Number of bins and Y-axis limits.
  \item X-axis min and max values, and optionally a random seed.
}
Interactive buttons allow resetting the histogram, aligning bars to the top or bottom,
and exporting the generated data.

The D3.js code handles the histogram drawing and interaction, while Shiny manages inputs and server-side data processing.
